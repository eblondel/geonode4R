R Interface to GeoNode REST API â€“ Allows to perform programmatically from R

`geonode4R` is a new package to perform operations of the GeoNode REST API. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and search on GeoNode resources.

### 1. Overview and vision
***

Until now, equivalent tools were existing for other programming languages (e.g. Java, Python) but not in R. [geonode4R](https://github.com/eblondel/geonode4R) intends to provide R native interface to the GeoNode REST API, in order to facilitate publication of geographic data resources from R to [GeoNode](https://geonode.org/).

<a name="package_status"/>

### 2. Development status
***

A first version is being published to CRAN.

The package is at its early stage. It aims to be consolidated together with improvements made on the GeoNode API, and based on feedback of the user community.

<a name="install_guide"/>

#### 4.1 How to install geonode4R in R

For now, the package can be installed from Github
```R
install.packages("remotes")
```
Once the devtools package loaded, you can use the install_github to install ``geonode4R`` By default, package will be installed from ``master`` which is the current version in development (likely to be unstable). 

```R
remotes::install_github("eblondel/geonode4R")
```

<a name="GeoNodeManager"/>

#### 4.2 Connect to GeoNode REST API 

The main entry point of ``geosapi`` is the `GeoNodeManager``. To configure it, enter the following line, specifying the base ``URL`` of your GeoNode, and your credentials:
```R
geonode <- GeoNodeManager$new(
    url = "http://localhost:8080/geonode", #baseUrl of the Geoserver
    user = "admin", pwd = "password", #credentials
    logger = NULL #logger, for info or debugging purpose
)
```

By default, the ``geonode4R`` **logger** is deactivated. To enable the logger, specify the level of log you wish as parameter of the above R code. Two logging levels are available:

* ``INFO``: will print the ``geonode4R`` logs. Three types of messages can be distinguished: ``INFO``, ``WARN``, ``ERROR``. The latter is generally associated with a ``stop`` and indicate an blocking error for the R method executed.
* ``DEBUG`` will print the above ``geonode4R`` logs, and report all logs from HTTP requests performed with ``cURL``

The ``GeoNodeManager`` inherits all methods of resource dependent managers, to provide the users with a single R interface to GeoNode REST API operations.

<a name="GeoNodeManager-create"/>

#### 4.3 Create a resource

To upload a shapefile or another resource, list the resource files (e.g. a list of ESRI Shapefiles), and use the `upload` method of the `GeoNodeManager`.

```R
files = list.files(system.file("extdata/samples", package = "geonode4R"), pattern = "shapefile1", full.names = T)
files = files[!endsWith(files, ".zip")]
created = GEONODE$upload(files)
```


<a name="GeoNodeManager-read"/>

#### 4.4 Read a resource

To get a resource, you can get it based on a dataset identifier ('pk'), or get it by UUID or alternate dataset. The below examples show how to perform these tasks.

```R
#getResource
resource = GEONODE$getResource(created$dataset)

#getResourceByUUID
resource_by_uuid = GEONODE$getResourceByUUID(resource$uuid)

#getResourceByAlternate
resource_by_alternate = GEONODE$getResourceByAlternate("shapefile1")
```

<a name="GeoNodeManager-delete"/>

#### 4.5 Delete a resource

To delete a resource, use the `deleteResource` method of the `GeoNodeManager`:

```R
deleted = GEONODE$deleteResource(created$dataset)
```
